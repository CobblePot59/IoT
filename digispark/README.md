The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line,
only cheaper, smaller, and a bit less powerful.

1) Start "DPinst64.exe" located in Digistump Drivers to install the drivers.
2) In the Arduino IDE from the "Preferences> Additional Boards Manager URLs" add the following URL: http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json
3) In the Arduino IDE from the "Tools> Card Type> Card Manager" menu, find and install Digistump AVR Boards.
4) In the Arduino IDE from the "Tools> Card Type" menu, select Digispark (Default - 16.5mhz).
5) Copy the contents of the DigisparkKeyboard folder into "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\digistump\hardware\avr\1.6.7\libraries\DigisparkKeyboard" to use the French keyboard.

More than coding ;)
